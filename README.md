# Archean mystery

This is repository for the Skoltech Bioinformatics course final project.

*Keywords*: gene annotation, protein annotation, horizontal gene transfer, operons, synteny

In this project I performed annotation and analysis of the unclassified Thermoplasmata genome. I used such tools as: *Prokka, barrnap, tRNAscan-SE, BLAST, MEME, HMMER, antiSAMSH, PADLOC, SynTax*. Different students were provided with the different parts of the unknown genome. My results showed, that the certain loci (22 521 bp long) does not carry any specific interesting genes, but may be an example of horizontal gene transfer. You may take a closer look at my [report](https://github.com/nvaulin/Sk_Bioinf_Project/blob/main/Vaulin_Project.pdf), if you are interested.
